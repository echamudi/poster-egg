# Posty Poster

> This app is still under heavy development and not suitable for normal user 😃

A client-side poster maker using HTML5, CSS3, and Angular. The code is written by using [VSCode](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode).

## Browser Compatibility

This app is targeted to run on Chrome (>= 36), Firefox (>= 45), and Opera (Blink).

Won't work in Safari, IE, and Edge. You can try this [codepen test](http://codepen.io/ezh/pen/RrLZqM) on those browsers. Anyone knows the workaround?

## How to Run

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ezhmd/posty-poster.git posty-poster/posty-poster
$ cd posty-poster/posty-poster
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

Make sure 'Bundle Function 📦' is finished before opening the server.
